Hi, I'm Austin. This is my blog. On this blog I will share programming 
projects, write some tutorials (which will help me learn), and write 
about sports mostly from a statistical perspective.

This site was created using [jekyll][jekyll-site] and is hosted for 
free on [netlify][netlify-site]. [Netlify][netlify-site] allows users 
to continuously update their static sites via a git repository. You can 
find the repository for this site [here][git-repo].
